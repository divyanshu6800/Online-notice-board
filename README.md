IMPORTANT!
The following web-application is not designed for "mobile view" and works at full potential on desktops.
The passwords of the admin/users are not encrypted and can be seen by the database manager.
The website was created to host locally on my system and the code might require some modifications to make it run on your system.
Please proceed keeping the above points in mind.
